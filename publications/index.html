Elevated levels of CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 were associated with progression-free survival and a diverse baseline infiltrating T-cell receptor repertoire was prognostic. Differential gene expression analysis revealed elevated expression of CALCA (preprocalcitonin) and CCDC183 (highly expressed in testes) in patients who experienced clinical activity, suggesting that tumor neoantigens from these genes may contribute to immune response. In patients who experienced partial response or stable disease, elevated Igα2 expression correlated with T- and B-cell infiltration, suggesting that tertiary lymphoid structures existed in these patients’ tumors. Consensus gene co-expression network analysis identified core cellular pathways that may play a role in antitumor immunity.

MMRD and PPD cancers are commonly lethal due to the inherent resistance to chemo-irradiation. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have failed to benefit children in previous studies, we hypothesized that hypermutation caused by MMRD and PPD will improve outcomes following ICI treatment in these patients. Using an international consortium registry study, we report on the ICI treatment of 45 progressive or recurrent tumors from 38 patients. Durable objective responses were observed in most patients, culminating in a 3 year survival of 41.4%. High mutation burden predicted response for ultra-hypermutant cancers (\textgreater100 mutations per Mb) enriched for combined MMRD + PPD, while MS-indels predicted response in MMRD tumors with lower mutation burden (10–100 mutations per Mb). Furthermore, both mechanisms were associated with increased immune infiltration even in ‘immunologically cold’ tumors such as gliomas, contributing to the favorable response. Pseudo-progression (flare) was common and was associated with immune activation in the tumor microenvironment and systemically. Furthermore, patients with flare who continued ICI treatment achieved durable responses. This study demonstrates improved survival for patients with tumors not previously known to respond to ICI treatment, including central nervous system and synchronous cancers, and identifies the dual roles of mutation burden and MS-indels in predicting sustained response to immunotherapy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="beck_genomic_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The genomic landscape of pediatric renal cell carcinomas</div> <div class="author"> Pengbo Beck, Barbara Selle, Lukas Madenach, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 11 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '11 more authors' ?

We validated these clusters using immunohistochemistry, methylation immune inference, and segmentation analysis of tissue images. We report shared biology of these immune clusters within and across cancer types, and characterization of specific immune-cell frequencies as well as T- and B-cell repertoires. We found no associations between immune infiltration levels and tumour mutational burden, although molecular cancer entities were enriched within specific immune clusters.

Despite the immense knowledge generated through sequencing efforts and functional characterization of identified (epi-)genetic alterations over the past decade, the clinical implications of this knowledge have so far been limited. Novel preclinical platforms such as the European Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer–Paediatric Preclinical Proof-o f-Concept Platform and the US-based Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium are being developed to try to change this by aiming to recapitulate the extensive heterogeneity of paediatric tumours and thereby, hopefully, improve the ability to predict clinical benefit. Numerous studies have also been established worldwide to provide patients with access to real-time molecular profiling and the possibility of more precise mechanism-o f-action-b ased treatments. In addition to tumour-intrinsic findings and mechanisms, ongoing studies are investigating features such as the immune microenvironment of paediatric tumours in comparison with adult cancers — currently of very timely clinical relevance. However, there is an ongoing need for rigorous preclinical biomarker and target validation to feed into the next generation of molecularly stratified clinical trials. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive state-o f-the-a rt overview of the molecular landscape of paediatric solid tumours, including their underlying genomic alterations and interactions with the microenvironment, complemented with our current understanding of potential therapeutic vulnerabilities and how these can be preclinically tested using more accurate predictive methods.

It is a stoichiometric member of the minimal NuA4 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex consisting of EAF6, EPC1, ING3, and TIP60. This complex is responsible for the transcription of an essential cascade of genes involved in embryonic development and in tumour suppression. ING3 has been linked to head and neck and hepatocellular cancers, although its status as a tumour suppressor has not been well established. Recent studies suggest a pro-metastasis role in prostate cancer progression. Here, we describe a transgenic mouse strain with insertional mutation of an UbC-mCherry expression cassette into the endogenous Ing3 locus, resulting in the disruption of ING3 protein expression. Homozygous mutants are embryonically lethal, display growth retardation, and severe developmental disorders. At embryonic day (E) 10.5, the last time point viable homozygous embryos were found, they were approximately half the size of heterozygous mice that develop normally. µCT analysis revealed a developmental defect in neural tube closure, resulting in the failure of formation of closed primary brain vesicles in homozygous mid-gestation embryos. This is consistent with high ING3 expression levels in the embryonic brains of heterozygous and wild type mice and its lack in homozygous mutant embryos that show a lack of ectodermal differentiation. Our data provide direct evidence that ING3 is an essential factor for normal embryonic development and that it plays a fundamental role in prenatal brain formation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="dantas_biological_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Biological Functions of the ING Proteins</div> <div class="author"> Arthur Dantas, Buthaina Al Shueili, Yang Yang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

These multidomain adaptor proteins interact with numerous other proteins to facilitate their localization and the regulation of numerous biochemical pathways that impinge upon biological functions. Knockout of some of the ING genes in murine models by various groups has verified their status as tumor suppressors, with ING1 knockout resulting in the formation of large clear-cell B-lymphomas and ING2 knockout increasing the frequency of ameloblastomas, among other phenotypic effects. ING4 knockout strongly affects innate immunity and angiogenesis, and INGs1, ING2, and ING4 have been reported to affect apoptosis in different cellular models. Although ING3 and ING5 knockouts have yet to be published, preliminary reports indicate that ING3 knockout results in embryonic lethality and that ING5 knockout may have postpartum effects on stem cell maintenance.

The ING family of epigenetic regulators (ING1-5) function by targeting histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase complexes to the H3K4me3 mark to alter histone acetylation and subsequently, gene expression. Here we find that ectopic expression of ING5, the targeting subunit of HBO1, MOZ and MORF HAT complexes increases expression of the Oct4, Olig2 and Nestin stem cell markers, promotes self-renewal, prevents lineage differentiation and increases stem cell pools in BTIC populations. This activity requires the plant homeodomain region of ING5 that interacts specifically with the H3K4me3 mark. ING5 also enhances PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK activity to sustain self-renewal of BTICs over serial passage of stem cell-like spheres. ING5 exerts these effects by activating transcription of calcium channel and follicle stimulating hormone pathway genes. In silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas data suggest that ING5 is a positive regulator of BTIC stemness, whose expression negatively correlates with patient prognosis, especially in the Proneural and Classical subtypes, and in tumors with low SOX2 expression. These data suggest that altering histone acetylation status and signaling pathways induced by ING5 may provide useful clinical strategies to target tumor resistance and recurrence in glioblastoma.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mcclurg_molecular_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Molecular mechanism of the TP53-MDM2-AR-AKT signalling network regulation by USP12</div> <div class="author"> Urszula L.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this signalling network are not completely defined. By conducting transcriptome analysis, denaturing immunoprecipitations and immunopathology, we demonstrate that the TP53-MDM2-AR-AKT cross-talk is regulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP12 in prostate cancer. Our findings explain why USP12 is one of the 12 most commonly overexpressed cancer-associated genes located near an amplified super-enhancer. We find that USP12 deubiquitinates MDM2 and AR, which in turn controls the levels of the TP53 tumour suppressor and AR oncogene in prostate cancer. Consequently, USP12 levels are predictive not only of cancer development but also of patient’s therapy resistance, relapse and survival. Therefore, our findings suggest that USP12 could serve as a promising therapeutic target in currently incurable castrate-resistant prostate cancer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mcclurg_human_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Human ex vivo prostate tissue model system identifies ING3 as an oncoprotein</div> <div class="author"> Urszula L.

METHODS: We transduced ex vivo benign prostate hyperplasia tissues with inducible lentiviral particles to express ING proteins. Proliferation was assessed by H3S10phos immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of ING3 was assessed by IHC on a human prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA). Gene expression was measured by DNA microarray and validated by real-time qPCR. RESULTS: We found that ING3 stimulates cellular proliferation in ex vivo tissues, suggesting that ING3 could be oncogenic. Indeed, ING3 overexpression transformed normal human dermal fibroblasts. We observed elevated levels of ING3 in prostate cancer samples, which correlated with poorer patient survival. Consistent with an oncogenic role, gene-silencing experiments revealed that ING3 is required for the proliferation of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer cells. Finally, ING3 controls the expression of an intricate network of cell cycle genes by associating with chromatin modifiers and the H3K4me3 mark at transcriptional start sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations create a shift in the prevailing view that ING proteins are tumour suppressors and redefine ING3 as an oncoprotein.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="nabbi_ing3_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ING3 promotes prostate cancer growth by activating the androgen receptor</div> <div class="author"> Arash Nabbi, Urszula L.

INhibitor of Growth (ING) proteins target lysine acetyltransferase or lysine deacetylase complexes to the histone H3K4Me3 mark of active transcription, to affect chromatin structure and gene expression. ING3 is a stoichiometric member of the TIP60 lysine acetyltransferase complex implicated in prostate cancer development. METHODS: Biopsies of 265 patients with prostate cancer were stained for ING3, pan-cytokeratin, and DNA. LNCaP and C4-2 androgen-responsive cells were used for in vitro assays including immunoprecipitation, western blotting, Luciferase reporter assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability and migration assays were performed in prostate cancer cell lines using scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting ING3. RESULTS: We find that ING3 levels and AR activity positively correlate in prostate cancer. ING3 potentiates androgen effects, increasing expression of androgen-regulated genes and androgen response element-driven reporters to promote growth and anchorage-independent growth. Conversely, ING3 knockdown inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and invasion. ING3 activates the AR by serving as a scaffold to increase interaction between TIP60 and the AR in the cytoplasm, enhancing receptor acetylation and translocation to the nucleus. Activation is independent of ING3’s ability to target the TIP60 complex to H3K4Me3, identifying a previously unknown chromatin-independent cytoplasmic activity for ING3. In agreement with in vitro observations, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data (n = 498) and a prostate cancer tissue microarray (n = 256) show that ING3 levels are higher in aggressive prostate cancers, with high levels of ING3 predicting shorter patient survival in a low AR subgroup. Including ING3 levels with currently used indicators such as the Gleason score provides more accurate prognosis in primary prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the majority of previous reports suggesting tumor suppressive functions in other cancers, our observations identify a clear oncogenic role for ING3, which acts as a co-activator of AR in prostate cancer. Data from TCGA and our previous and current tissue microarrays suggest that ING3 levels correlate with AR levels and that in patients with low levels of the receptor, ING3 level could serve as a useful prognostic biomarker.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="almami_ing3_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients</div> <div class="author"> Amal Almami, Samar A.

Although its expression has been reported in various types of cancers, the role of ING3 and its prognostic value in prostate cancer (PCa) has not been investigated. ING3 expression and prognostic value was assessed in a cohort of PCa patients (n = 312) treated with transurethral resection of prostate using immumoflourescent automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) system. In vitro studies were carried out in conjunction to investigate its expression in various PCa cell lines. ING3 knockdown was also carried out in DU145 cell lines to assess for any changes in invasion and migration. ING3 expression was highest in benign prostate tissues (mean 3.2 ± 0.54) compared to PCa (mean 2.5 ± 0.26) (p = 0.437), advanced prostate cancer (AdvPCa) (mean 1.5 ± 0.32) (p = 0.004), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (mean 2.28 ± 0.32) (p = 0.285). ING3 expression was inversely correlated to Gleason score (p = 0.039) and ETS-related gene (ERG) expression (p = 0.019). Higher ING3 expression was marginally associated with lethal disease (p = 0.052), and this was more pronounced in patients with ERG-negative status (p = 0.018). Inhibition of ING3 in DU145 PCa cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with decreased cell invasion (p = 0.0016) and cell migration compared to control cells. ING3 is significantly associated with PCa disease progression and cancer-specific mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting an oncogenic function of ING3, previously well known as a tumor suppressor protein. Further studies should investigate potential-related pathways in association to ING3.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mcclurg_ubiquitin-specific_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ubiquitin-specific protease 12 interacting partners Uaf-1 and WDR20 are potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer</div> <div class="author"> Urszula L.

Unfortunately, current therapies are not curative for castration resistant PC and a better understanding of AR regulation could identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers to aid treatment of this disease. The AR is known to be regulated by a number of post-translational modifications and we have recently identified the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp12 as a positive regulator of AR. We determined that Usp12 deubiquitinates the AR resulting in elevated receptor stability and activity. Furthermore, Usp12 silencing was shown to reduce proliferation of PC cells.Usp12 is known to require the co-factors Uaf-1 and WDR20 for catalytic activity. In this report we focus further on the role of Uaf-1 and WDR20 in Usp12 regulation and investigate if these co-factors are also required for controlling AR activity. Firstly, we confirm the presence of the Usp12/Uaf-1/WDR20 complex in PC cells and demonstrate the importance of Uaf-1 and WDR20 for Usp12 stabilisation. Consequently, we show that individual silencing of either Uaf-1 or WDR20 is sufficient to abrogate the activity of the Usp12 complex and down-regulate AR-mediated transcription via receptor destabilisation resulting in increased apoptosis and decreased colony forming ability of PC cells. Moreover, expression of both Uaf-1 and WDR20 is higher in PC tissue compared to benign controls. Overall these results highlight the potential importance of the Usp12/Uaf-1/WDR20 complex in AR regulation and PC progression. HIGHLIGHTS: • Androgen receptor is a key transcriptional regulator in prostate cancer • Usp12/Uaf-1/WDR20 complex plays a crucial role in androgen receptor stability and activity • Destabilising an individual Usp12/Uaf-1/WDR20 complex member reduces the protein levels of the whole complex and diminishes androgen receptor activity • Protein levels of all members of the Usp12/Uaf-1/WDR20 complex are significantly increased in PC.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="thakur_stromal_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Stromal ING1 expression induces a secretory phenotype and correlates with breast cancer patient survival</div> <div class="author"> Satbir Thakur, Arash Nabbi, Alexander Klimowicz, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Here we analyzed levels of ING1 in breast cancer patients to determine its prognostic significance as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis. METHODS: We used automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) to determine the levels of ING1 in the tumor associated stromal cells of 462 breast cancer samples. To better understand how high ING1 levels affect nearby epithelium, we measured the levels of cytokines and secreted matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), using an ELISA based assay in mammary fibroblasts overexpressing ING1. These cells were also used in a 3-dimensional co-culture with MCF7 cells to determine the effect of released MMPs and other cytokines on growing colonies. RESULTS: We find that high levels of ING1 in stroma are associated with tumor grade (p = 0.001) and size (p = 0.02), and inversely associated with patient survival (p = 0.0001) in luminal, but not in non-luminal cancers, suggesting that high stromal ING1 promotes cancer development. In this group of patients ING1 could also predict patient survival and act as a biomarker (HR = 2.125). While ING1 increased or decreased the expression of different cytokines, ING1 also increased the levels of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP10 by 5-8 fold, and concomitantly decreased levels of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases TIMP2, TIMP3 and TIMP4 by 1.5-3.3 fold, resulting in significant increases in MMP activity as determined by zymography. Co-culturing of MCF7 cells with stromal cells expressing ING1 in 3-dimensional organoid cultures suggested that MCF7 colonies were less well defined, suggesting that secreted MMPs might promote migration. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that stromal ING1 expression can predict the survival of patients with luminal breast cancer. High levels of ING1 in stromal cells can promote the development of breast cancer through increased expression and release of MMPs and down regulation of TIMPs, which may be an underlying mechanism of reduced patient survival.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="nabbi_ing3_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ING3 protein expression profiling in normal human tissues suggest its role in cellular growth and self-renewal</div> <div class="author"> Arash Nabbi, Amal Almami, Satbir Thakur, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

The founding member of the family, ING1, was initially identified as a tumor suppressor with altered regulation in a variety of cancer types. While alterations in ING1 and ING4 levels have been reported in a variety of cancer types, little is known regarding ING3 protein levels in normal or transformed cells due to a lack of reliable immunological tools. In this study we present the characterization of a new monoclonal antibody we have developed against ING3 that specifically recognizes human and mouse ING3. The antibody works in western blots, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Using this antibody we show that ING3 is most highly expressed in small intestine, bone marrow and epidermis, tissues in which cells undergo rapid proliferation and renewal. Consistent with this observation, we show that ING3 is expressed at significantly higher levels in proliferating versus quiescent epithelial cells. These data suggest that ING3 levels may serve as a surrogate for growth rate, and suggest possible roles for ING3 in growth and self renewal and related diseases such as cancer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="nabbi_isolation_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Isolation of Nuclei</div> <div class="author"> Arash Nabbi, and Karl Riabowol </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cold Spring Harbor Protocols</em>, Aug 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The isolation of nuclei is often the first step in studying processes such as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, subcellular localization of proteins, and protein-chromatin or nuclear protein-protein interactions in response to diverse stimuli.

Historically, the isolation of nuclei involved a homogenization step followed by centrifugation through high-density glycerol or sucrose. Although clean nuclei with little cytoplasmic contamination can be prepared using this method, it is typically time consuming and can allow protein degradation, protein modification, and leaching of components from the nuclei to occur. We have developed a rapid and simple fractionation method that is based on the selective dissolution of the cytoplasmic membrane (but not the nuclear membrane) using a low concentration of a nonionic detergent and rapid centrifugation steps.

A mild detergent, NP-40, is used together with mild mechanical shearing to disrupt the plasma membrane, leaving the nuclear membrane intact.

Since their discovery in 1996, ING proteins have been classified as type II tumour suppressors on the basis of reports describing their down-regulation and mislocalization in a variety of cancer types. In addition to their regulation by transcriptional mechanisms, understanding the range of PTMs (post-translational modifications) of INGs is important in understanding how ING functions are fine-tuned in the physiological setting and how they add to the repertoire of activities affected by the INGs. In the present paper we review the different PTMs that have been reported to occur on INGs. We discuss the PTMs that modulate ING function under normal conditions and in response to a variety of stresses. We also describe the ING PTMs that have been identified by several unbiased MS-based PTM enrichment techniques and subsequent proteomic analysis. Among the ING PTMs identified to date, a subset has been characterized for their biological significance and have been shown to affect processes including subcellular localization, interaction with enzymatic complexes and ING protein half-life. The present review aims to highlight the emerging role of PTMs in regulating ING function and to suggest additional pathways and functions where PTMs may effect ING function.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Arash Nabbi.
