Thrilled to see my work on biomarker analysis of pediatric tumors treated with atezolizumab online in Nature Cancer. I would like to thank collaborators at Genentech/Roche as well as funders for this important study highlighting the value of personalized immunotherapy in pediatric cancers. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00534-x">Multimodal immunogenomic biomarker analysis of tumors from pediatric patients enrolled to a phase 1-2 study of single-agent atezolizumab</a>
