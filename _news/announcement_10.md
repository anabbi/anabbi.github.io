Thrilled to announce that my postdoctoral work on immunogenomic analysis of pediatric CNS tumors and neurobastomas is now online at Genome Medicine. I would like to thank collaborators at the German Cancer Center (DKFZ), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and members of the PROFYLE program in Canada for their help and input during this project. <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01219-x#Abs1">Transcriptional immunogenomic analysis reveals distinct immunological clusters in paediatric nervous system tumours</a>
